00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.08
- [Mary] Are you read to graduate

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:05.07
from coding simple demos to
writing real applications?

3
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:08.06
We'll start with a basic
Spring Boot Microservice,

4
00:00:08.06 --> 00:00:11.01
then elevate it to a
production-ready application

5
00:00:11.01 --> 00:00:13.01
employing standards of quality,

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:16.04
security, persistence and deployment.

7
00:00:16.04 --> 00:00:19.04
I'm talking about external
databases with schema versioning,

8
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:22.06
secured APIs, progression test coverage

9
00:00:22.06 --> 00:00:24.08
and application delivery with Docker.

10
00:00:24.08 --> 00:00:26.09
Hi, I'm Mary Ellen Bowman.

11
00:00:26.09 --> 00:00:28.05
I'm a senior job developer

12
00:00:28.05 --> 00:00:30.06
and I regularly employ these standards

13
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:32.07
when creating solutions.

14
00:00:32.07 --> 00:00:34.00
If you are up to the challenge,

15
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:37.01
then I invite you to join
me on this learning journey.

16
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:37.09
So let's go!
