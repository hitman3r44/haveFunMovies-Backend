00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.00
- [Instructor] So now that
we understand the project,

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:04.06
let's start up the application

3
00:00:04.06 --> 00:00:07.09
and exercise some of the APIs
by launching the application

4
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:11.06
and invoke them via Postman.

5
00:00:11.06 --> 00:00:13.05
So, on ExplorecaliApplication,

6
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:18.06
I'm gonna right click it and say run.

7
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:22.03
And we'll watch the console.

8
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:27.04
So we see it started
with Tomcat on port 8080.

9
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:29.02
Now I've launched Postman

10
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:33.08
and I'll show you that
you can import a set,

11
00:00:33.08 --> 00:00:45.00
a collection API calls.

12
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:48.09
This API Demo 1 postman
collection.json file,

13
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:53.02
if you click that and open it,
I've already got it opened,

14
00:00:53.02 --> 00:00:55.05
it will launch and then start

15
00:00:55.05 --> 00:00:58.03
with this Explore
California API's collection.

16
00:00:58.03 --> 00:01:00.00
And this is just a shortcut I've added

17
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:03.07
so you don't have to type in
each one of the API calls.

18
00:01:03.07 --> 00:01:05.08
So, within the Introduction folder,

19
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:10.06
select the first one which
is Get All Tour Packages.

20
00:01:10.06 --> 00:01:14.00
So here's the http call to
get all the tour packages.

21
00:01:14.00 --> 00:01:16.09
Click Send.

22
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:20.02
And we see there's our tour packages,

23
00:01:20.02 --> 00:01:27.00
our Backpack Cali, California
Hot Springs, et cetera.

24
00:01:27.00 --> 00:01:32.03
Now, let's get all of the tours.

25
00:01:32.03 --> 00:01:36.08
Here's all the details of
my Big Sur Retreat Tour,

26
00:01:36.08 --> 00:01:40.02
Death Valley,

27
00:01:40.02 --> 00:01:42.07
Mount Whitney Climbers Tour.

28
00:01:42.07 --> 00:01:48.05
Now, if I wanna look up
a tour by a tour package

29
00:01:48.05 --> 00:01:52.07
and here I provide the code
equals BC which is Backpack Cali

30
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:58.02
so that's gonna fetch just
the Backpack Cali Tours.

31
00:01:58.02 --> 00:02:02.07
Next, let's create a rating.

32
00:02:02.07 --> 00:02:06.09
In the body of that I'm
sending a json string.

33
00:02:06.09 --> 00:02:10.00
The score is five.

34
00:02:10.00 --> 00:02:11.08
The comment was, "I thought it was okay."

35
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:14.00
And the customer ID is eight.

36
00:02:14.00 --> 00:02:18.09
And this would be for the
tour with the ID equal one.

37
00:02:18.09 --> 00:02:21.06
Send that that post method and let's see.

38
00:02:21.06 --> 00:02:24.08
The results was that that was created.

39
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:26.07
Now let's look up a rating.

40
00:02:26.07 --> 00:02:31.07
Let's call the tours
slash 1 slash ratings API

41
00:02:31.07 --> 00:02:36.04
which will get all the
ratings for tour one.

42
00:02:36.04 --> 00:02:39.05
And there's the one we just created.

43
00:02:39.05 --> 00:02:44.06
Let's get the average score for a tour.

44
00:02:44.06 --> 00:02:46.06
And the average score was five.

45
00:02:46.06 --> 00:02:49.07
And let's update a
rating with the put verb.

46
00:02:49.07 --> 00:02:55.00
So, we're going to update the tour rating.

47
00:02:55.00 --> 00:02:59.00
Have customer four who
thought it was not that great

48
00:02:59.00 --> 00:03:03.09
and a score of one.

49
00:03:03.09 --> 00:03:06.03
This has been a very quick overview

50
00:03:06.03 --> 00:03:09.00
of our starting point code base.

51
00:03:09.00 --> 00:03:11.01
If you have access to the exercise files,

52
00:03:11.01 --> 00:03:13.01
I really encourage you to take the time

53
00:03:13.01 --> 00:03:15.08
to familiarize yourself with it.

54
00:03:15.08 --> 00:03:19.01
Good developers are always
looking to improve their code.

55
00:03:19.01 --> 00:03:23.00
So, developer, we know this
is not production ready.

56
00:03:23.00 --> 00:03:24.01
How can we do better?
